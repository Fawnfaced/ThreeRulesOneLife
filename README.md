# ThreeLifesThreeRules
Three Lives, Three Rules is a fast-paced top-down roguelike where your survival depends on adapting to constantly changing rules. Every round, three random rules are in effect — from reversed controls to slow movement or enemy rushes — forcing you to think and react quickly. Can you survive all three?
