# Three Rules, One Life
**Three Rules, One Life** is a fast-paced top-down roguelike where your survival depends on adapting to constantly changing rules.  
Every round, three random rules are in effect — from reversed controls to slow movement or enemy rushes — forcing you to think and react quickly. Can you survive all three?

##  Controls
- **Move:** WASD / Arrow Keys
- **Shoot:** Left Mouse Button
- **Pause:** Esc

##  How to Play
- At the start, you have **3 lives**.
- Three random rules are active each round — they can limit your movement, change how enemies behave, or make you take damage when standing still.
