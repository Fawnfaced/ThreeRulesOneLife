# Three Rules, One Life

**Three Rules, One Life** is a fast-paced top-down roguelike where your survival depends on adapting to constantly changing rules.  
Every round, three random rules are in effect — from reversed controls to slow movement or enemy rushes — forcing you to think and react quickly. Can you survive all three?

##  Controls
- **Move:** WASD / Arrow Keys
- **Shoot:** CTRL

---

## How to Play
- You start with **3 lives**.
- At any time, three random rules are active — they can limit your movement, change enemy behavior, or make you take damage when standing still.
- Adapt quickly to survive as long as possible.
- When all lives are lost, the game ends.
